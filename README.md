# Random_Network_Simulation_Using_OMNeT-
This mini-project involves simulating a network of 8 nodes connected in a random topology, where a message is sent from one node to another while recording the hop count (number of intermediate nodes). Once the message reaches its destination, the destination is changed dynamically, allowing multiple source-destination pairs to be analyzed.
