# Random_Network_Simulation_Using_OMNeT-
This mini-project involves simulating a network of 8 nodes connected in a random topology, where a message is sent from one node to another while recording the hop count (number of intermediate nodes). Once the message reaches its destination, the destination is changed dynamically, allowing multiple source-destination pairs to be analyzed. This project provides valuable insights into message transmission efficiency by analyzing hop counts through visualizations like histograms or line charts. Future enhancements include implementing routing algorithms for optimized pathfinding, dynamic network topology adjustments, and traffic analysis to study network performance under varying conditions.
